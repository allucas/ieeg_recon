# iEEG Recon
iEEG electrode reconstruction pipeline

# Installation

## Docker

We recommend using the Docker container available here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lucasalf11/ieeg_recon

## Python 

For a standalone python installation, we recommend you have Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) with at least Python 3.7

With Anaconda and Python installed, clone the repository, and open a terminal window in the directory where the repository was cloned into. Type the following command:

```
conda env create -f ieeg_recon_config.yml
```

This will create a conda virtual environment called `ieeg_recon`. To activate the environment type:

`conda activate ieeg_recon`
